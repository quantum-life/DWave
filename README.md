# DWave Quantum Computing
# Todd Lohvinenko August 2019

The purpose of this location is to experiment on the D-Wave Quantum Computer using 
the https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap QPU. Over time I hope to add more experiments to 
the D Wave Quantum Computer and learn the QUBO and BQM solution sets through the 
Quantum annealing (QA)  process for finding the global energy minimums of a given 
objective function over a given set of  solutions.
